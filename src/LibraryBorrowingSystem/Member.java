/**
 * Represents a library member who can borrow, return, and search for items.
 * Inherits from Person — gains id and name.
 *
 * A Member is a specific type of Person who interacts with the library
 * by borrowing and returning LibraryItems (Books or Multimedia).
 * The member can hold up to MAX_BORROW items at the same time.
 *
 * Inheritance:
 *   Member extends Person
 *   - Inherits : id, name (and their getters/setters)
 *   - Adds     : borrowedItems array, borrowCount
 *   - Overrides: getInfo(), toString()
 *
 * Overloading:
 *   searchItem(catalog, size, keyword) — search by keyword
 *   searchItem(catalog, size)          — no keyword, lists all available items
 *
 * Attributes:
 *   - borrowedItems : array of items the member is currently borrowing
 *   - borrowCount   : number of items currently borrowed
