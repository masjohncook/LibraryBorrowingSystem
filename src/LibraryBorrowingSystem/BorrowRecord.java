/**
 * Represents a single borrow transaction in the library system.
 *
 * A BorrowRecord is created every time a member borrows a LibraryItem
 * (which can be a Books or a Multimedia object), and it is updated when
 * the item is returned. It links a Member and a LibraryItem together
 * with date information.
 *
 * Associations:
 *   - member : links to the Member who borrowed the item  (Member)
 *   - item   : links to the item that was borrowed        (LibraryItem)
 *
 * Attributes:
 *   - recordId   : unique identifier for this record (e.g. "REC001")
 *   - member     : the member who borrowed the item
 *   - item       : the item that was borrowed (Books or Multimedia)
 *   - borrowDate : the date the item was borrowed
 *   - returnDate : the date the item was returned ("-" if not yet returned)
 *   - returned   : true if the item has been returned, false otherwise
